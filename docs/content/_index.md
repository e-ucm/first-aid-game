# Teaching first-aid procedures to high school students

The First-Aid game was commissioned by the [Aragonese Center for Educational Technologies](http://www.catedu.es/) (CATEDU), as a tool to teach high school students basic first-aid and reanimation procedures.

It was developed by the [e-UCM Research Group](https://www.e-ucm.es) using [e-Adventure](https://e-adventure.e-ucm.es), an authoring platform for the creation of educational games. It is distributed under a Creative Commons license (by-nc-sa).

This site hosts the English version of the game, with a special focus on TEL research applications. For Spanish documentation and to download the original game currently being used by CATEDU in Aragonese high schools, visit the [CATEDU website section on educational games](http://catedu.es/webcatedu/index.php/descargas/e-adventures).
