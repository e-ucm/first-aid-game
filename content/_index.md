# Teaching first-aid procedures to high school students

The First-Aid game was commissioned by the [Aragonese Center for Educational Technologies](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.catedu.es%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGqeETLNC11oul84Co4HBKoT6hhRA) (CATEDU), as a tool to teach high school students basic first-aid and reanimation procedures.

It was developed by the [e-UCM Research Group](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.catedu.es%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGqeETLNC11oul84Co4HBKoT6hhRA) using [e-Adventure](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fe-adventure.e-ucm.es%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFIXP_QhZ-i-jw2Kr_RvPeJdnfO_Q), an authoring platform for the creation of educational games.
