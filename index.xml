      <description>The first-aid game was created to teach high school students how to perform basic first-aid and resuscitation procedures including, when available, the use of a portable defibrillator as the ones being deployed in most public spaces across Spain.
The game was commissioned by the CATEDU, to study its potential deployment alongside the ongoing effort to organize sessions in different high schools where a medical professional visits the school to arrange a tutorial.</description>
