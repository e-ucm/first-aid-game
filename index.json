Instrucción en maniobras de soporte vital básico mediante videojuegos a escolares: comparación de resultados frente a un grupo control. Emergencias. 2012;24:433-7. (download PDF)\nAbstract Objectives: 1) To assess the usefulness of an educational video game to teach the theory of basic life support to high school students; 2) to compare video game instruction to the traditional teaching of basic life support maneuvers through practical demonstrations by healthcare professionals.\nMethods: An educational video game was developed according to the ILCOR 2010 guidelines. The study was carried out in a sample of 344 secondary school students in Aragon, Spain. The students, who were allocated to an experimental group and a control group, took a test before and after instruction in order to detect change in knowledge.\nResults: Viable data were obtained for 331 students. The 187 students in the experimental group had a mean grade of 4.51 (out of a maximum score of 10) before playing the game, and a mean grade of 7.48 afterwards. Students in the control group had a mean grade of 4.95 before and 8.56 afterwards. The differences in each group were significant (t test). After bivariate analysis of variance, the differences in both groups remained significant.\nConclusions: The experimental group achieved a significant increase in theoretical knowledge, although they learned less than students in the control group. The relevance of these results rests on the lower cost per instructional session for the video game, which can be played an unlimited number of times without supervision, as opposed to the high cost of providing visits of healthcare professionals to all high schools.
